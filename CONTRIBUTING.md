# Pull Requests

Pull requests should be made against the `working` branch.

# Coding Guidelines

In general, I follow strict pep8 and pyflakes.  All code must pass these tests. Since we support python 2.4-3.4, pyflakes reports unknown names in python 3.  pyflakes is run in python 2.7 only in my tests.

# Supported Python Versions

All code needs to support Python 2.4-3.4.

# Testing

Currently there are no unit tests, but they are planned.
